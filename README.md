## Problem Statement
Vehicular networks enable vehicles to communicate with each other and with roadside infrastructure. These smart vehicles are constrained in terms of computational capacity. Task offloading is a technique to perform computation intensive tasks in a coordinated manner by sharing the task load.

We have proposed an efficient technique for task offloading to reduce average computation time and the probability of failed task computations.

In summary, this project revolves around:
- Lack of computational capacity in smart vehicles
- Latency issues with cloud
- Task offloading decisions

### Data
- Dataset is generated using the [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) traffic simulator.
- Different variants from the dataset are served through an API developed with FastAPI on Heroku.
